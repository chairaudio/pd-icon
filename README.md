This is a small repo for the (revamped) Pure Data icon in use as of Pd 0.49. It is essentially a higher-quality version of the previous Pure Data icon tweaked with sizing and positioning from the Pd-extended icon. It also reflects the default font used by Pd's patch canvas, DejaVu Sans Mono.

The icon was created using a Pd patch exported to SVG using the patch2svg-plugin and tweaked in Inkscape (larger font, wider char spacing, etc).

The makefile uses a master 1024x1024 png file as a source for:

* macOS app & file .icns icon set
* Windows .ico
* 256x256 .gif
* X11 .xpm (tweaked to shift font 1 pixel to right for readability)

The macOS file icon is generated by shrinking & compositing over the default system file icon.

The master files are:

* masters/GenericDocumentIcon.png: macOS default file icon
* masters/icon.svg: master svg, exported from Pd and tweaked in Inkscape
* masters/icon1024.png: exported PNG from Inkscape
* masters/patch: source Pd patches

Any generated icons which required hand tweaking are located in the 'tweaked' directory so they are not overwritten by the makefile.

Generating
----------

### PNG -> icon sets

You will need ImageMagick installed. Also, the macOS icon sets can only be generated on a macOS system (requires iconutil).

If you want to tweak the icon or generate icon sets with your own design, create a 1024x1024 PNG and either replace the master/icon124.png file or edit the Makefile to use yours. Then run `make`.

### Using Inkscape for SVG -> PNG icon set

Additionally, you can generate a set of pd-#.png at different resolutions directly from the source .svg file using Inkscape:

    make inkscape

For the default font to render, you will need DejaVu Sans Mono installed.

Linux icon install
------------------

To register and install the mimetype type:

    make mime-register


Testing and Updated Icon in Pd
------------------------------

If you want to try out an updated/new icon with your own copy of Pd:

macOS: 

  * Close Pd if it is running
  * Right-click on the Pd .app & choose "Show Package Contents"
  * Navigate to Contents/Resources
  * Rename and/or replace the existing .icns files with the new ones
  * Start the Pd .app

Windows:
  
  * Close Pd if it is running
  * Rename and/or replace the existing .ico file in the Pd install directory
  * Start Pd

Linux: ? Probably requires replacing an icon file (depends on desktop environment)
