This is a small repo for the Pure Data icon.

The makefile uses a master 1024x1025 file as a source for:

* macOS app & file .icns icon set
* Windows .ico
* 256x256 .gif

You will need ImageMagick installed. The macOS icon sets can only be generated on a macOS system (requires iconutil).

The icon was created using a Pd patch exported to PostScript. The PS file was then converted to SVG and tweaked in Inkscape.

The macOS file icon is generated by shrinking & compositing over default macOS file icon.

The master files are:

* masters/GenericDocumentIcon.png: macOS default file icon
* masters/icon\_inkscape.svg: master Inkscape file
* masters/icon.ps: PostScript export from Pd
* masters/icon.svg: exported SVG from Inkscape
* masters/icon2014.png: exported PNG from Inkscape
* masters/patch: source Pd patches
